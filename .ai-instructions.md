# AI Assistant Instructions for Bleurgh CLI

This file provides context and guidance for AI assistants helping users with the Bleurgh CLI tool.

## What is Bleurgh?

Bleurgh is a command-line tool for purging Fastly CDN cache by surrogate keys. It supports multiple environments (dev/test/prod) and can work with arbitrary environment variable names.

## Common User Requests and How to Help

### "Help me run this" / "How do I use this?"

**Step 1: Check if they have Node.js**
```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

**Step 2: Install the CLI**
```bash
# Global installation (recommended)
npm install -g bleurgh

# Or run without installing (uses npx)
npx bleurgh --help

# Or run from source
npm install
npm run build
```

**Step 3: Set up authentication**
- They need a Fastly API token from: https://manage.fastly.com/account/personal/tokens
- Set it as an environment variable:
```bash
export FASTLY_TOKEN="their-actual-token"
```

**Step 4: Configure services**
- They need their Fastly service IDs
- Common patterns:
```bash
export FASTLY_DEV_SERVICE_IDS="service1,service2"
export FASTLY_TEST_SERVICE_IDS="service3,service4"
export FASTLY_PROD_SERVICE_IDS="service5,service6"
export FASTLY_DEFAULT_KEYS="global,always"
```

**Step 5: Test with dry run**
```bash
bleurgh user-123 --dry-run
# Or with npx (if not globally installed)
npx bleurgh user-123 --dry-run
```

### "I'm getting authentication errors"

1. Check if `FASTLY_TOKEN` is set: `echo $FASTLY_TOKEN`
2. Verify token has correct permissions in Fastly dashboard
3. Try: `bleurgh --help` to see if CLI is working

### "I don't know my service IDs"

1. They can find them in Fastly dashboard
2. Or use Fastly API: `curl -H "Fastly-Token: $FASTLY_TOKEN" https://api.fastly.com/service`
3. Service IDs are usually alphanumeric, like `7i5ZX1FAwS339v2gNGNL`

### "How do I set this up for my team?"

**For administrators:**
1. Set up environment variables with all needed service IDs (and friendly names, service ids are usually not friendly)
2. Run: `bleurgh --generate-setup`
3. Share the generated setup string with team
4. Team members run: `bleurgh --setup <setup-string>`

**Team members only need:**
- The setup string from admin
- Their own FASTLY_TOKEN

### "It's not working" / Troubleshooting

**Common issues:**
1. **No FASTLY_TOKEN**: User gets 401/403 errors
2. **Wrong service IDs**: User gets 404 errors  
3. **No service environment variables**: Tool says "no services found"
4. **Global install issues**: Try running from source instead

**Debugging commands:**
```bash
# Check what services are configured
bleurgh --help | grep -A 10 "Environment Variables"
# Or with npx
npx bleurgh --help | grep -A 10 "Environment Variables"

# Test with verbose output
bleurgh user-123 --dry-run --verbose
# Or with npx
npx bleurgh user-123 --dry-run --verbose

# Check if global install worked
which bleurgh
```

## Important Implementation Details

### Environment Variables
- Uses any `FASTLY_*` environment variables for service configuration
- Supports arbitrary environment names (not just DEV/TEST/PROD)
- Examples: `FASTLY_STAGE_SERVICE_IDS`, `FASTLY_CUSTOM_ENV_SERVICE_IDS`
- Never exports `FASTLY_TOKEN` in setup strings for security

### Command Patterns
```bash
# Basic usage
bleurgh <cache-key>

# Multiple keys
bleurgh key1 key2 key3

# Specific environment
bleurgh <key> --env dev

# Specific services (override environment)
bleurgh <key> --services service1,service2

# Purge everything
bleurgh --all

# Always test first
bleurgh <key> --dry-run
```

### Security Notes
- FASTLY_TOKEN is never included in setup strings
- Setup strings only contain service IDs and configuration
- Each user must set their own FASTLY_TOKEN

### File Structure
- `src/index.ts` - Main CLI entry point
- `src/core.ts` - Core purging logic
- `src/setup.ts` - Setup string generation/import
- `scripts/generate-setup.ts` - Example setup generation
- `README.md` - User documentation

## Development Help

### Running from source
```bash
git clone <repo>
cd bleurgh
npm install
npm run build
npm test

# Run without installing globally
npx tsx src/index.ts --help
```

### Testing setup generation
```bash
# Set up test environment variables first
npx tsx scripts/generate-setup.ts
```

### Common development tasks
```bash
npm test           # Run tests
npm run build      # Compile TypeScript
npm run dev        # Development mode
```

## When to Escalate

Refer users to the README.md or GitHub issues if:
1. They need advanced configuration not covered here
2. They're reporting bugs or unexpected behavior
3. They want to contribute or modify the tool
4. They need help with Fastly API specifics beyond basic service IDs

## Quick Reference

**Most common successful flow:**
1. `npm install -g bleurgh` (or use `npx bleurgh` to run without installing)
2. Get Fastly token, set `FASTLY_TOKEN`
3. Get service IDs, set `FASTLY_*_SERVICE_IDS` 
4. Test: `bleurgh test-key --dry-run` (or `npx bleurgh test-key --dry-run`)
5. Use: `bleurgh actual-key` (or `npx bleurgh actual-key`)
